# Maxwell Lattice Project

This code package is developed to perform phonon mode analysis, fit spring constants from calculated energy curves, and perform Brownian dynamics (BD) simulation.

Data: 09/2023.

The mode analysis and spring constant parts are developed and tested using Matlab 2021a.  

The BD simulation part is developed and tested using LAMMPS (29sep2021) and Matlab 2021a.

## Getting started

The mode analysis and spring constant parts of the codes can be used upon downloading. All five examples of particle trajectory are provided for the mode analysis, and 3 energy curves are provided for nearest neighbor (NN) spring and angular (ANG) spring fitting. The example data are included as '.mat' files.
