# Maxwell Lattice Project

This code is developed for performing mode analysis and spring constant fitting on calculated energy curves. One example particle trajectory is provided for the mode analysis, and 3 energy curves are provided for nearest neighbor (NN) spring and angular (ANG) spring fitting.

Data: 09/2023.

This code is tested using Matlab 2021a.
